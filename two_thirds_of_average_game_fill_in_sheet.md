Rules:

1.  Every player must write a whole number between 0 and 100 on this
    sheet.
2.  The winner of the game will be the player whose number is closet to
    2/3 of the average of all the numbers written by all the players.

Example:

There are 3 players who guessed the following numbers:
3, 67 and 84. The average would be $\frac{3+67+84}{3}=51.33$. The closest guess to 2/3 of the average (34.22) is the player whose guess was 3.
