    <h1>Two thirds of the average game</h1>

    <p>Welcome to this online version of the two thirds of the average game. </p>

    <p>Here's the rules of the game as given on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guess_2/3_of_the_average">wikipedia page</a>:
    <blockquote>
        "In game theory, Guess 2/3 of the average is a game where several people guess what 2/3 of the average of their guesses will be, and where the numbers are restricted to the real numbers between 0 and 100, inclusive. The winner is the one closest to the 2/3 average."
    </blockquote>

    <p> I (as do many people) use this game quite a lot in my teaching and and during outreach events and I've blogged about it <a href="http://goo.gl/MrXDd">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p> It's a nice game to get participants to understand concepts of dominated strategies: </p>

    <p> If you'd like to play please fill in the form below. I will announce the winners and share the data on my <a href="http://drvinceknight.blogspot.co.uk/">blog</a> (but won't let you know the winning guess straight away in case this information gets shared...). If you leave a name and a url I'll happily point to it on my blog :)</p>

    <p><b>Be careful you are only allowed one guess! Your last collected guess will be the one that counts.</b></p>
